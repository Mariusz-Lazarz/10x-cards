A lightweight web app for quickly creating and managing study flashcards using AI-assisted generation. Users can paste text and receive suggested flashcards (question/answer pairs) generated by an LLM, review and accept or edit suggestions, and manage their personal flashcard collections.

## Project description

10x-cards helps users rapidly create high-quality flashcards for learning by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to propose question/answer pairs from user-provided text. The workflow focuses on speed and user control: the AI suggests flashcards, and the user may accept, edit, or reject each suggestion before saving to their private collection.

Key user flows (from PRD):
- Paste a piece of text (1000–10,000 characters) and request AI-generated flashcard suggestions.
- Review the generated list and accept, edit or reject individual flashcards.
- Save accepted flashcards to the user’s personal collection, edit or delete saved cards.
- Use an external spaced-repetition algorithm (MVP uses an existing open-source solution) to run study sessions.

Privacy and data handling notes from the PRD: user data and flashcards must be stored in a scalable and secure manner; RODO/GDPR compliance (right to access and deletion) is required for production use.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: Astro 5 + React 19 (for interactive components)
- Language: TypeScript 5
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
- UI primitives: Shadcn/ui (Radix + Tailwind-based components)
- Backend / Auth / DB: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- AI integration: Openrouter.ai (adapter to multiple LLM providers)
- CI/CD / Hosting: GitHub Actions suggested; Docker + DigitalOcean for hosting

Files confirming stack and versions:
- `package.json` (project version: 0.0.1)
- `.nvmrc` (Node version: 22.14.0)

---

## Getting started (locally)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js: use the version in `.nvmrc` (v22.14.0) — recommended to use `nvm` to manage versions
- Git
- Supabase project (for production/local dev if using Supabase features)
- API key for Openrouter.ai (or another LLM provider configured via Openrouter)

### Quick start

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd 10x-project
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment variables

Copy or create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file at the project root and add required keys. Example variables (names are suggestions — confirm in the codebase):

```env
# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# AI / Openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

4. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

---

## Available scripts

Scripts available in `package.json`:

- `npm run dev` — Start Astro dev server
- `npm run build` — Build the production site
- `npm run preview` — Preview the production build locally
- `npm run astro` — Run Astro CLI
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint on the codebase
- `npm run lint:fix` — Run ESLint with autofix
- `npm run format` — Run Prettier to format files

---

## Project scope

This project is focused on delivering an MVP for AI-assisted flashcard generation and basic user management.

In-scope (MVP):
- AI-generated flashcards from user-provided text (review / accept / edit / reject)
- Manual creation, editing and deletion of flashcards
- Basic user authentication and account management (register / login / delete account)
- Integration with an existing spaced-repetition algorithm for study sessions
- Storage of user and flashcard data in a scalable database (Supabase/Postgres)
- Collection of simple metrics on generated vs accepted cards

Out-of-scope for MVP (per PRD):
- Advanced spaced-repetition algorithm development (use external/open-source)
- Gamification features and mobile apps
- Importing multiple document formats (PDF/DOCX)
- Public API or sharing flashcards between users
- Advanced notification system and extensive search features

---

## Project status

- Repository scaffolded with Astro + React + TypeScript and initial dependencies configured (`package.json`, `.nvmrc`).
- Product requirements and scope defined in `./.ai/prd.md`.
- AI integration approach defined (Openrouter.ai) and backend choice (Supabase) chosen in `./.ai/tech-stack.md`.

Next recommended steps:
- Add a `LICENSE` file and choose a license (MIT recommended if not otherwise required)
- Add repository `README` (this file) to the repo root (created)
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` if expecting external contributions
- Add environment-specific configuration and an example `.env.example` with documented variable names
- Wire CI (GitHub Actions) and add a status badge

## License

License: Not specified in the repository. Please add a `LICENSE` file at the project root. Suggested default: MIT.

---

## Notes / Next steps

- The PRD specifies GDPR compliance requirements (data access and deletion). Plan database schemas and API routes accordingly.
- Document required environment variables and any Supabase setup steps in a dedicated `docs/` folder or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- If you want, replace the placeholder badges above with real CI / coverage / license badges once those systems are configured.
